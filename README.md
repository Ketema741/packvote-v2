## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GratitudeDriven/packvote-ui.git
cd packvote-ui
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` with your configuration:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=your_api_url
```

4. Start development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Testing

The project uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing. Tests are located in `__tests__` directories next to the components they test.

1. Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

2. Run tests with coverage:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

3. Run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- Component rendering and interactions
- Form validation and submission
- API integration
- Error handling
- User interactions and navigation
- Responsive design behavior

## Development

This is a React-based application using:
- React Router for navigation
- React Testing Library for testing  
- Material-UI (MUI) for UI components and styling
- Regular CSS files for custom styling
- Axios for API requests
- SurveyJS for survey functionality

### Key Components

- `CreateTrip`: Handles trip creation with participant management
- `TripSurvey`: Collects participant preferences and availability (7-step survey using SurveyJS)
- `Dashboard`: Displays trip status and management options
- `VotingPage`: Facilitates destination voting with ranking interface
- `WinnerPage`: Shows final trip details
- `AIRecommendationsPage`: AI-powered destination recommendation generation
- `SocialSharePage`: Social sharing and communication features

### Development Components (Development mode only)

- `DevSettings`: Development configuration and testing tools
- `UnsplashApiTest`: Image API testing and integration verification

### Best Practices

1. Write tests for new components
2. Follow component structure guidelines
3. Maintain responsive design using Material-UI breakpoints
4. Handle loading and error states consistently
5. Use inline validation in components

## Contributing

1. Create a new branch for your feature
2. Write tests for new functionality
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Submit a pull request

## Development Workflow

This repository follows a structured development workflow with separate development and production environments:

### Branch Structure
- `main` - Production branch, protected from direct pushes
- `dev` - Development branch for testing changes before production


### Environment Configuration
- Development environment uses development API endpoints and Supabase project
- Production environment uses production API endpoints and Supabase project
- Environment variables are stored as GitHub Secrets and used by the deployment workflows

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Tests run automatically on both `dev` and `main` branches
- Development deployments occur automatically when changes are pushed to `dev`
- Production deployments require passing tests and occur after merging to `main`

## Deployment Status

**IMPORTANT: The application is not yet deployed to any environment.** 

The GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/` currently contain placeholders for deployment steps, which have been commented out until actual deployment is implemented. Only the test jobs remain active to ensure code quality.

Required secrets for future deployment:
- `SUPABASE_URL` - URL of your Supabase project
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Anonymous key for Supabase client access
- `DEV_API_URL`/`PROD_API_URL` - Currently uses localhost during development

Currently, the application uses `localhost` for API connections. When deploying, these placeholder values will need to be updated with actual deployment URLs.

Once deployment targets are established, the deployment workflows will be updated accordingly.

### Development Process
1. Create feature branches from `dev`
2. Implement and test your changes locally
3. Submit a pull request to merge into `dev`
4. After testing in the development environment, create a pull request from `dev` to `main`
5. Once approved and merged, changes will be deployed to production
